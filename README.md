## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Get Your GroupMe Access Token:**

    *   Find your "Access Token" – it's like a secret key that lets this app talk to GroupMe on your behalf.
    *   **Important:** Keep this token secret! Don't share it with anyone. 🤫
2.  **Open the App:**
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **Enter Your Token:**
    *   The app will ask you for your GroupMe Access Token. Paste it in and click "Save".
4.  **Start Managing!**
    *   Once your token is saved, you'll see a list of your bots. Click on a bot to view or edit its details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
